Predefined macro names
======================
The following macro names are always defined (they all begin and end with two underscore characters, _):
========================================================================================================================================================
macro	                value                                                                                                                           |
========================================================================================================================================================
__LINE__	            Integer value representing the current line in the source code file being compiled.                                             |
__FILE__	            A string literal containing the presumed name of the source file being compiled.                                                |
__DATE__	            A string literal in the form "Mmm dd yyyy" containing the date in which the compilation process began.                          |
__TIME__	            A string literal in the form "hh:mm:ss" containing the time at which the compilation process began.                             |
__cplusplus	            An integer value. All C++ compilers have this constant defined to some value. Its value depends on the version of the standard  |
                        supported by the compiler:                                                                                                      |
                                                                                                                                                        |
                        - 199711L: ISO C++ 1998/2003                                                                                                    |
                        - 201103L: ISO C++ 2011                                                                                                         |
                                                                                                                                                        |
                        Non conforming compilers define this constant as some value at most five digits long.                                           |
                        Note that many compilers are not fully conforming and thus will have this constant defined as neither of the values above.      |
__STDC_HOSTED__	        1 if the implementation is a hosted implementation (with all standard headers available)                                        |
                        0 otherwise.                                                                                                                    |

__STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__	            1 if multibyte encoding might give a character a different value in character literals                                      |

__STDCPP_THREADS__	                    1 if the program can have more than one thread                                                                              |

Particular implementations may define additional constants.
